## Battleships Challenge

We have to create the battleships game, I've isolated the small steps to achieve this ( well maybe not):

#### A player is created:

* has a name
* has a board
* Can shoot to a board
* Can see his own grid
* Can see if he still has ships floating

#### A board is created:

* Boards are 10x10 grids
* Each board is an array
* Boards have columns and rows.
* Each row is an array
* To call a value you have to pick a row and then the column
* ships are created.
* A ship can take up more than one element
* A ship can be present in more than one row/column
* Registers shots, shows if you hit the water or a boat
* Can see the opponents view, hidding the living ships new
